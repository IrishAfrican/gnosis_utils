Updated to work with Python 3 by running through 2to3 and fixing types and some other minor changes.
No guarantees this will work as I have only made these changes as I need this to work for something that is supplemental to what I am going.

You will need to rebuild using "python setup.py install" and any references to Python 1 or 2 are probably obsolete
